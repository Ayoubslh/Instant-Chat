## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 Priority Classification

Your inbox finally knows what’s urgent. Emails are automatically labeled as High, Medium, or Low priority, so you never miss what’s critical.

### 📂 Smart Email Grouping

Meet your new folders—smarter and dynamic. Emails are grouped into meaningful categories like Work, Newsletters, Meetings, etc., with no manual sorting.

### 🧠 AI Email Summarization

No need to scroll through long threads. Get concise summaries of every email, generated by our AI agent in seconds.

### 💬 Suggested Replies

Never type the same response twice. The AI drafts smart, context-aware replies—ready for review and one-click send.

### ✅ Key Action Extraction

Each email includes a clear "Key Action"—what you need to do, whether it’s reply, schedule, forward, or ignore.

### ✉️ Create & Send Emails

Compose new messages directly through the app with AI-generated content when you need a quick, professional response.
